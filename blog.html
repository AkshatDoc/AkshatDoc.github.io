            <h2>Student Opinion: Strike or Nah</h2>
            <h5>Strike Season, Dec 04, 2019</h5>
            <p>
                For the first time in what seems like forever, I have not had to go to school on a Wednesday! This is two sides of a coin as for one, I didn't have to write my final math test for Advanced Functions but I also realized that I built my muskokao chair poorly
                and I'll have to wait a whole day to attempt to fix it. So from brief research of the topic, the OSSFT(Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation) attempted to reach an agreement with the government yesterday but because no acceptable
                deal was reached, the teachers went on strike. There was a lot of "shade" thrown at the government from the OSSFT through tweets such as <a href="https://twitter.com/octugal/status/1202049119172333570"> this</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/Travisdhanraj/status/1202046382342754306"> this</a>.
                As many people have said, this is the first real strike where students, parents and educators are on the same side. However, I have mixed feelings. Of course I want to have smaller class sizes, no mandatory e-learning and I want my lost
                teachers back but the cost of this strike to my education, if continued to escalate, could be detrimental to my future aspirations of becoming an entrepreneur and mechatronics engineer! I stand with my teachers and other educators affected
                by these changes and I hope a resolution that is beneficial to both parties can be reached very soon because if the students are suffering, who really wins?

            <h2>Dance Dance Revolution</h2>
            <h5>Are School Dances Any Good?, Nov 27, 2019</h5>
            <p>
                Let me preface this by saying that most of my close friends are extremely introverted. Our social interactions are limited to events we volunteer at, movies and the occasional hang out. This dance was big news. In the past, I didn't want to go to these
                dances because of a couple reasons(which in hindsight don't make that much sense). The first issue was the cost, which I would rationalize by saying "I can use that money elsewhere". Did I use that money elsewhere? No, not at all because
                it wasn't my money I was using. The second reason was because none of my friends went, which wasn't actually true. The only friends that didn't go were those antisocial ones from before. I knew more people than I realized and on top of
                that, no one cares once you start dancing. All of these problems went away this year along with some self-realization. One of my friends got a girlfriend, so he was going to the "formal" dance. Along with that, a new friend of mine was
                running it, so he would have to be there. The cost stayed the same from previous years at a steep $60, but my great parents wanted me to try this out, which gave me the push I needed.
            </p>

            <p>
                Oh man, this night was amazing. The beginning was a little rocky with all the photos and me arriving to a house full of just girls gettting ready. The photos were rough, with the bright ring light and about 3 different cameras to look at. When we arrived
                at the location, things were a little better. We were talking socializing, gettting aquianted with the crowd and then came the awards and dinner(both meh). When we started dancing, that was the beginning of the night. From the moshing,
                YMCA, jumping, singing and all around energy, the night could not have gone better. A small trip to McDonalds really proved me wrong. I got to talk with people who I haven't talked to since grade 9 and it was really fun reconnecting with
                them. Overall: Dances are pretty cool. Even with the constant supervision and pat down searches. Find some friends and tear up the night!

            <h2>Charity: Donations?</h2>
            <h5>The Plain Sight Robbery, Nov 26, 2019</h5>
            <p>
                I think I have found a new purpose for this blog. I feel like everyday we have such interesting conversations with people from all around, and certain points come up that stick with you. For example: My father and I were in the car listenting to the Radio
                when an ad about donating to homeless children. The ending to the ad was a little girl saying "don't you care?" or something along those lines. When I heard this, I thought "oh so sad" but I guess my dad heard "oh scam" and completely
                agreed with me. My father believes donations are scam because 70% of the donations go to administrations. I will further uncover the truth about this through this post.
            </p>
            <p>
                So there were a bunch of articles that came up when I searched "where does my donation money go?". A couple of the articles seem trustworthy but as soon as I see any contridiction, we'll be in hot water(10:53pm) <br>Here are the websites:<br>
                <a href="https://charity.lovetoknow.com/What_Percentage_of_Donations_Go_to_Charity"> https://charity.lovetoknow.com/What_Percentage_of_Donations_Go_to_Charity</a>, <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/charities/best-charities-for-your-donations/"> https://www.consumerreports.org/charities/best-charities-for-your-donations/</a>,
                <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/phil-froats/how-much-money-goes-to-charity_b_2566538.html"> https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/phil-froats/how-much-money-goes-to-charity_b_2566538.html</a>, <a href="https://www.spondylitis.org/Where-Does-My-Donation-Go">https://www.spondylitis.org/Where-Does-My-Donation-Go</a>
            </p>

            <p> From a reading through these 4 articles, I have found out that 17% of charities revenue comes from this holiday season alone, which makes sense since it is the time to give back. WHat I did find truly shocking is that a lot of good sounding
                charities actually spend "30 cents or more for every donated dollar on things like overhead, administrative costs, and fundraising" such as The Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation or American Printing House for the Blind. Overall, most
                charities do take percents to pay for "overhead" costs, such as admin, fundraisers and other necessities for the charity to grow, not just a flat 70%. As the season of jolly green and red comes around, you have to make sure that your money
                is going to the right place which can be achieved by searching more about the tax exemption, paying directly to the charity, Don't reply to telemarketers or mail campaigns and VOLUNTEER!(11:17)
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall: not all charities take big cuts from your donations, but it is up to you to find out the truth about where the money goes(11:19)

            <h2>Absurdism</h2>
            <h5>Am I a victim of Cirmumstance?, Nov 26, 2019</h5>
            <p> Through our french class, we were exposed to the idea of "Absurdism" from Albert Camus. Using the book "L'Étranger", we were able to analyze the main character as an image of "Absurdism". Meursault has key personality traits that can be used
                to quntify an absurd man or "l'homme absurde"
                <ul>
                    <li>Insensed</li>
                    <li>Indifference</li>
                    <li>Routine</li>
                    <li>Randomness</li>
                    <li>Determisnism</li>
                    <li>Despair</li>
                </ul>
                Typically Hypochondriacs are describes as become unduly alarmed about any physical symptoms they detect, no matter how minor the symptom may be, and are convinced that they or others have, or are about to be diagnosed with, a serious illness. However,
                this definition misses a key point: the pyschological aspect. After studying this book, I became more aware of my routine, my "callous" and nonchalant behaviour causing me to self diagnos as absurd. Luckily, I was wrong. My "boredem" took
                me for a trip, making me feel absurd. My routine was the same everyday at a very broad look, but each day differed in meaningful ways through friends and interactions. My "callous" behaviour was not really meant to cause pain or malice,
                but to highlight flaws in peoples views. In short, I am not a victim of cirmunstance nor absurd, just me.
                <br>
                <strong>TLDR; I became absurd through my self-diagnosed hypocondria(the irony)</strong>
