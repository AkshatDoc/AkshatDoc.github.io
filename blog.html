            <h2>Skynet Sleep</h2>
            <h5>Back in the game, Jan 20, 2020</h5>
            <p>
                I have been offline for far too long. From schoolwork to university applications, I haven't made enough time to focus on the website as I once used to. Now I am back in the game with a new project in the works. Simply put, I want my laptop to sleep when
                my lights are off and wake up when my lights are turned on. I figured I would use my Arduino skills as well as my newly discovered Python skills to the test. I found how to read values from an Arduino to my laptop from this
                <a href="https://realpython.com/arduino-python/#hello-world-with-arduino"> link</a>. Updates to come soon after my first Semester exams.
            </p>

            <p>Update 1: 27th Jan 2020. SO I figured out how to communicate between the arduino and laptop but now my laptop will keep locking on itself. Need to add easy escape.</p>

            <p>Update 2: 23rd April 2020. I have upgraded a very long way. Instead of just running my computer to turn off, I have changed it up in order to control my room lights via Arduino. I have been able to use a SSR(Solid State Relay) and control
                a lamp light via voice control(Python Speech recognition) as well as from a web server(Flask). Now the webserver is in debugging mode which I have been working on getting set up(very slowly). The voice control is all set up and does not
                need miuch other than a place to live. I have also been given access to an Ubuntu server in NYC. No clue what to do with it. At first I wanted to upload the website there, but soon realized that I would have to buy a domain and as a soon
                to be broke university student, that didn't seem smart. What to do? What to do?</p>

                <h2>Carrom: An Indian Man's Billiards</h2>
                <h5>Geometry or Magic, Dec 09, 2019</h5>
                <p>
                    So a while back(maybe 2 years), my dad and I got very competitve in a bunch of different things from how many pull-ups to chess and this specific game: <strong>carrom</strong>. As the title implies, Carrom is a game believed to be
                    originated in the Indian Subcontient(pretty big place). It became very popular after World War I with state-level competitions held in the different states of India. By 1958, both India and Sri Lanka had formed official federations
                    of carrom clubs, sponsoring tournaments and awarding prizes. There is even a Federation in India founded in Chennai. The game itself is pretty simple: Use your striker(big white coin) to hit the colored coins into the pockets. There
                    are different nuances as compared to pool like: your color is predefined, you are able to hit other players coins, no penalty for missing everything etc. One of the major differences is the queen piece. This is a red piece like the
                    regular coins but has two special restrictions. Restriction #1: Once the red coin is pocketed(scored), another "cover" coin must be scored or the queen is returned to the middle and Restriction #2: The queen must be scored before the
                    end of the game(can't score it as your last coin). What makes the queen so special is it's point value. Each coin is worth 1 point but the queen is worht 5 points! This leads us organically to the scoring mechanics of the game. The
                    way the scoring works seems a little strange and really differes from billiard in this way. You take the sum total of the coins left by your opponent, which becomes your points. You continue play boards(matchs) until one player reachs
                    29 points. Now the queen, as mentioned earlier, is worth 5 additional points so your score for a board can be expressed in an equation as : #coins_left + 5(if queen was scored by you). At this point you're probabaly wondering why I'm
                    talking about this wacky pool like game and what it has to do with magic. Well, I recently got into the game with my father again, which then showed me how crazy the game really is.
                    <img class="img-thumbnail" height=" 200px " width="200px " src="https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/5a/Play-Carrom-for-Beginners-Step-3-Version-2.jpg/aid664099-v4-900px-Play-Carrom-for-Beginners-Step-3-Version-2.jpg "></img><br>                    So the board can be seen above. What makes the game so "magical " is the application of basic Geometry within it. Looking at a real game by pros, you could not believe the shots they make and how they clear the board, but when you
                    break it down, it's just a bunch of cool triangles<iframe width="560 " height="315 " src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/84mCVyXPEJc " frameborder="0 " allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture "
                        allowfullscreen></iframe>.<br> An interesting aspect I forgot to mention was the formation of the board and who gets what colour. As illustrated above, the queen is the center, with 6 coins around it(alternating color) and then 12
                    coins above that. Whoever is breaking must pot white coins and the other will pot the black coins. Now there are no "awesome trickshots " in this video, but just imaginge trying to hit a cylinder to another cylinder at fancy angles
                    and different cuts to pot it in. It's not very easy(first hand experience). Some of the shots people make convince me that this game is magic like this video: <iframe width="560 " height="315 " src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aZOephZQuG8
                    " frameborder="0 " allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture " allowfullscreen></iframe>.
                </p>

                <p>This game is a ton of fun and I am so glad I got back into it. I just hope I don't lose my skills anytime soon and continue playing!</p>

                <h2>Student Opinion: Strike or Nah</h2>
                <h5>Strike Season, Dec 04, 2019</h5>
                <p>
                    For the first time in what seems like forever, I have not had to go to school on a Wednesday! This is two sides of a coin as for one, I didn't have to write my final math test for Advanced Functions but I also realized that I built my Muskoka chair poorly
                    and I'll have to wait a whole day to attempt to fix it. So from brief research of the topic, the OSSFT(Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation) attempted to reach an agreement with the government yesterday but because no acceptable
                    deal was reached, the teachers went on strike. There was a lot of "shade " thrown at the government from the OSSFT through tweets such as <a href="https://twitter.com/octugal/status/1202049119172333570 "> this</a>                    or
                    <a href="https://twitter.com/Travisdhanraj/status/1202046382342754306 "> this</a>. As many people have said, this is the first real strike where students, parents, and educators are on the same side. However, I have mixed feelings.
                    Of course, I want to have smaller class sizes, no mandatory e-learning and I want my lost teachers back but the cost of this strike to my education, if continued to escalate, could be detrimental to my future aspirations of becoming
                    an entrepreneur and mechatronics engineer! I stand with my teachers and other educators affected by these changes and I hope a resolution that is beneficial to both parties can be reached very soon because if the students are suffering,
                    who wins?

                <h2>Dance Dance Revolution</h2>
                <h5>Are School Dances Any Good?, Nov 27, 2019</h5>
                <p>
                    Let me preface this by saying that most of my close friends are extremely introverted. Our social interactions are limited to events we volunteer at, movies and the occasional hang out. This dance was big news. In the past, I didn't want to go to these
                    dances because of a couple of reasons(which in hindsight don't make that much sense). The first issue was the cost, which I would rationalize by saying "I can use that money elsewhere ". Did I use that money elsewhere? No, not at all
                    because it wasn't my money I was using. The second reason was because none of my friends went, which wasn't actually true. The only friends that didn't go were those antisocial ones from before. I knew more people than I realized and
                    on top of that, no one cares once you start dancing. All of these problems went away this year along with some self-realization. One of my friends got a girlfriend, so he was going to the "formal " dance. Along with that, a new friend
                    of mine was running it, so he would have to be there. The cost stayed the same from previous years at a steep $60, but my great parents wanted me to try this out, which gave me the push I needed.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Oh man, this night was amazing. The beginning was a little rocky with all the photos and me arriving at a house full of just girls getting ready. The photos were rough, with the bright ring light and about 3 different cameras to look at. When we arrived
                    at the location, things were a little better. We were talking socializing, getting acquainted with the crowd and then came the awards and dinner(both meh). When we started dancing, that was the beginning of the night. From the moshing,
                    YMCA, jumping, singing, and all-around energy, the night could not have gone better. A small trip to McDonald's proved me wrong. I got to talk with people who I haven't talked to since grade 9 and it was really fun reconnecting with
                    them. Overall: Dances are pretty cool. Even with the constant supervision and pat-down searches. Find some friends and tear up the night!

                <h2>Charity: Donations?</h2>
                <h5>The Plain Sight Robbery, Nov 26, 2019</h5>
                <p>
                    I think I have found a new purpose for this blog. I feel like every day we have such interesting conversations with people from all around, and certain points come up that stick with you. For example, my father and I were in the car listening to the Radio
                    when an ad about donating to homeless children. The ending to the ad was a little girl saying "don 't you care?" or something along those lines. When I heard this, I thought "oh so sad" but I guess my dad heard "oh scam" and completely
                    agreed with me. My father believes donations are a scam because 70% of the donations go to administrations. I will further uncover the truth about this through this post.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So there were a bunch of articles that came up when I searched "where does my donation money go?". A couple of the articles seem trustworthy but as soon as I see any contradiction, we'll be in hot water(10:53 pm) <br>Here are the websites:<br>
                    <a href="https://charity.lovetoknow.com/What_Percentage_of_Donations_Go_to_Charity"> https://charity.lovetoknow.com/What_Percentage_of_Donations_Go_to_Charity</a>, <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/charities/best-charities-for-your-donations/"> https://www.consumerreports.org/charities/best-charities-for-your-donations/</a>,
                    <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/phil-froats/how-much-money-goes-to-charity_b_2566538.html"> https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/phil-froats/how-much-money-goes-to-charity_b_2566538.html</a>, <a href="https://www.spondylitis.org/Where-Does-My-Donation-Go">https://www.spondylitis.org/Where-Does-My-Donation-Go</a>
                </p>

                <p> From reading through these 4 articles, I have found out that 17% of charity revenue comes from this holiday season alone, which makes sense since it is the time to give back. What I did find truly shocking is that a lot of good-sounding
                    charities spend "30 cents or more for every donated dollar on things like overhead, administrative costs, and fundraising" such as The Autism Spectrum Disorder Foundation or American Printing House for the Blind. Overall, most charities
                    do take percent to pay for "overhead" costs, such as admin, fundraisers and other necessities for the charity to grow, not just a flat 70%. As the season of jolly green and red comes around, you have to make sure that your money is
                    going to the right place which can be achieved by searching more about the tax exemption, paying directly to the charity, Don't reply to telemarketers or mail campaigns and VOLUNTEER! (11:17)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall: not all charities take big cuts from your donations, but it is up to you to find out the truth about where the money goes(11:19)

                <h2>Absurdism</h2>
                <h5>Am I a victim of Cirmumstance?, Nov 26, 2019</h5>
                <p> Through our French class, we were exposed to the idea of "Absurdism" from Albert Camus. Using the book "L'Étranger", we were able to analyze the main character as an image of "Absurdism". Meursault has key personality traits that can be
                    used to quntify an absurd man or "l'homme absurde"
                    <ul>
                        <li>Insensed</li>
                        <li>Indifference</li>
                        <li>Routine</li>
                        <li>Randomness</li>
                        <li>Determisnism</li>
                        <li>Despair</li>
                    </ul>
                    Typically Hypochondriacs are described as become unduly alarmed about any physical symptoms they detect, no matter how minor the symptom may be, and are convinced that they or others have, or are about to be diagnosed with, a serious illness. However,
                    this definition misses a key point: the psychological aspect. After studying this book, I became more aware of my routine, my "callous" and nonchalant behavior causing me to self diagnose as absurd. Luckily, I was wrong. My "boredom"
                    took me for a trip, making me feel absurd. My routine was the same every day at a very broad look, but each day differed in meaningful ways through friends and interactions. My "callous" behavior was not meant to cause pain or malice,
                    but to highlight flaws in peoples views. In short, I am not a victim of circumstance nor absurd, just me.
                    <br>
                    <strong>TLDR; I became absurd because of my hypochondria (the irony)</strong>
